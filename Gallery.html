          <div class="desc">During grade10 in 2016, I did Delphi as part of my IT subject. As time went by I was introduced to a Code4ct programme which introduces girls to using HTML,CSS,Javascript and JQuery to create websites. I have developed wide range of skills because of code4ct. Because I was one of the best code4ct alumnis I became the ambassador and also teached other young girls how to code at my school. The code4ct training environment is a dynamic and fun for the girls and it has been a pleasure to see friendships being forged between us girls and tutors.</div>

          <div class="desc">I had the privilege in 2017 of attending one the biggest hackathon in Town wich was WhereIsMyTransport. The hackathon was aimed at interrogating the data, creating solutions and products that not only increased the use and modes of public transport in Cape Town, but also empower Capetonians to travel further and experience more of the city. So me and my team created an ambitious system to provide an Uber-like experience for minibus-taxi users and make off-peak taxi operations more efficient. By connecting drivers, passengers, the WhereIsMyTransport platform, and a chatbot, users are able to receive real-time information about upcoming taxis, and drivers are notified of demand en route which was called FindMyTaxi. We became the grand prize winner.

          <div class="desc">Later on in 2017, I attended Santam Hackathon which was about finding solutions to South Africaâ€™s safety and security challenges. As MoreEyes team we came up with the use of biometric data to recognise and possibly prevent such crimes. The idea is to utilise facial recognition, heart rate and body temperature data to determine stress levels of employees and customers in the store. This data can then be used to identify current or imminent threats and can help alert security personnel while confirming the culprits of the crime. We then became the first prize winner.
